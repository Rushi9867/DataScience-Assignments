    "### 1. Compare and contrast the float and Decimal classes' benefits and drawbacks ?\n",
    "**Ans:** Both the float and decimal types store numerical values in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use floats when convenience and speed matter. A float gives us an approximation of the number we declare.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use decimals when precision matters. Decimals can suffer from their own precision issues, but generally, decimals are more precise than floats. The performance difference between float and decimal, with Python 3, is not outlandish, and in my experience, the precision benefits of a decimal outweigh the performance benefits of a float."

    "**Ans:** Floating-point value is converted to Decimal format. Decimal can store float value with absolute precision. But when float value is given as Decimal object,it first has to be converted from floating point value which might already have rounding error.\n",
    "\n",
